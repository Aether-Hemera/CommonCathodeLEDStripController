CommonCathodeLEDStripController
===============================

Arduino shield for a series of Common Cathode LED Strips 

====

Release 1 - 2012 09 04

This is the first release of the board.
Terminals are not close to each other and it's crammed.
But the benefit is that it's within the boundaries of Eagles's free license.

Enjoy
